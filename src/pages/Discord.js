                                            If the bot has to enact a message limiter on you because you are sending 
                                            too many messages within too short of a time frame, and it happens to frequently, 
                                            you will automatically be placed in the muted role for the corresponding amount of 
                                            time. See the puishment chart.

                                            that we cuss, and so do minors, however, if you start to use multiple cuss words per 
                                            sentence, or you are cussing in every single sentence, you will be muted. No question 
                                            about it. Be respectful. See rule one.

                                            of the discord, you will be banned and the Discord Staff will be notified.
